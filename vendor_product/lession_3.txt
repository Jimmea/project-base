CHAPTER 6 Product Attributes
The data tier components that support the product attributes feature include three data tables
(attribute, attribute_value, and product_attribute) and a stored procedure named catalog_
get_product_attributes.

The three data tables follow:
• attribute stores the name of the attributes, such as Size and Color.
• attribute_value contains the possible attribute values for each attribute group. There
is a one-to-many relationship between attribute and attribute_value. Each attribute,
take Color for example, can have several values associated with it—Red, Orange, Yellow,
and so on. We need this table to help us to link the attribute_id (like 1 for Color) to its
attribute_value_ids for its possible values (Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on). So, it will
contain three columns: attribute_id, which is found in the attribute table and tells us
what kind of attribute we are talking about (e.g., a color or a size); attribute_value_id,
the integer we assign to uniquely identify the items in the attribute_value table itself;
and value, which will hold the text description like Orange, Red, S (for small), M (for
medium), and so on.
• product_attribute is an associate table implementing a many-to-many relationship
between the product and attribute_value tables, with (product_id, attribute_value_id)
pairs (the attribute_value table will allow us to quickly and easily populate this table).

CHAPTER 8 SEARCHING THE CATALOG
    - search functionality of TShirtShop by using the full-text searching functionality of MySQL
    - The search mechanism integrated very well with the current web site structure and the paging functionality built in Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 9 INTEGRATE PayPal


CHAPTER 10 Catalog Administration: Departments and Categories
     More specifically, in this chapter we will create features that allow for
     • Adding and removing departments
     • Modifying existing departments’ information (name and description)
     • Viewing the list of categories that belong to a department
     • Adding and removing categories
     • Editing existing categories’ information (name and description)

     To secure the sensitive pages of your site, such as the administrative section, you’ll also do
     the following:
     • Implement a login form where the administrator needs to supply a username and
     password.
     • Learn how to secure the login form and the administrative pages using SSL.


CHAPTER 11 CATALOG ADMINISTRATION: PRODUCTS AND ATTRIBUTES
    In this chapter that will allow the site administrator to accomplish the following:
    • Manage product attributes, specifically list attribute values, add and delete attributes,
    and assign attributes to products
    • View the list of products in a specific category
    • Edit product details, such as the product’s name, description, price, or whether or not it
    is on promotion.
    • Assign an existing product to an additional category (a product can belong to multiple
    categories) or move it to another category.
    • Remove a product from a category
    • Delete a product from the catalog.
    • Allow administrators to access the department, category, or product administration
    pages right from the catalog.



CHAPTER 12 Creating Your Own Shopping Cart
    -- Create shopping_cart table
    CREATE TABLE `shopping_cart` (
    `item_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `cart_id` CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    `product_id` INT NOT NULL,
    `attributes` VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
    `quantity` INT NOT NULL,
    `buy_now` BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    `added_on` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`item_id`),
    KEY `idx_shopping_cart_cart_id` (`cart_id`)
    );

    • item_id is the primary key of the table. Its value uniquely identifies a shopping cart record.
    • cart_id is a CHAR(32) value that uniquely identifies a visitor’s shopping cart (as opposed to just one
    shopping cart record).
    • product_id references the ID of an existing product.
    • attributes is a varying character field that stores the attributes that were selected by the visitor when
    adding the product to the shopping cart. A possible value of this field can be, for example, "Color/Size:
    White/XL".
    • quantity stores the product quantity in the shopping cart.
    • buy_now is a Boolean field with the default value of true that supports the “Save for later” feature. When
    the customer checks out, only the products that have this value set to true are added to the order, whereas
    the “Save for later” products remain in the shopping cart.
    • added_on is a date field that is populated with the date the product was added to the cart. This value is
    used to calculate the age of a shopping cart, which gives us the ability to delete old shopping carts from the
    database.


CHAPTER 15 ■ PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS
    You can implement a product recommendations system in several ways, depending on your
    kind of store. Here are a few popular ones:
    - Up-Selling: Up-selling is the strategy of offering consumers the opportunity to purchase
    an upgrade or a little something extra based on their requested purchase. Perhaps the
    most famous example of up-selling—“Would you like to super-size that?”—is mentioned
    to customers when they order a meal at McDonald’s. This seemingly innocent question
    greatly increases the company’s profit margin.
    - Cross-Selling: Cross-selling is the practice of offering customers complementary products.
    Continuing with the McDonald’s analogy, when someone orders a hamburger, you’ll always
    hear the phrase, “Would you like fries with that?” Because it’s widely acknowledged that fries
    go with burgers, and the consumer is ordering a burger, it’s likely that the consumer also
    likes french fries—the mere mention of french fries is likely to generate a new sale.
    - Featured products on the home page: TShirtShop already permits the site administrator to
    choose the products featured on the main page and on the department pages.
